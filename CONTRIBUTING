# Contributing

Any contribution is welcomed, but they need to follow some rules :

* Fix any clippy lint (errors and warning). Allowing some is acceptable but they should be rare
  and have a comment explaining why it is allowed.

* Please run `rustfmt` with the nightly flag so the import are group with
  the granularity required.

* Commit must follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
  The commit type list is : `feat` ,`fix` ,`refactor` ,`style` ,`test` ,`docs` ,`build`.

* If contribution need any dependencies, it should be opt-in feature, I tried to minimise dependencies.
