# Boulette

Boulette provides an AST to evaluate objects against a boolean expression.

It's designed to be customizable, you can add your own operators and types if you need to.

It's purpose is not to parse a text into an AST though it could be added in future.

## Why should I use this crate

Well, you shouldn't, if you had to, you're screwed `:-)` ! It's probably not fast, at best it could be improved a lot.
It's probably buggy but at least bugs ain't there on purpose.
